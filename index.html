        <h2>One of my hometowns:</h2>
        <h1>Thessaloniki!</h1>

        <p>
        While I don't really have a hometown as I don't want to count the largely <i>boring</i> suburbs, I do have several "<i>semi</i>" hometowns that I feel connected to.
        <b>Thessaloniki</b> is one of those places, and <b>definitely</b> the most interesting. <b>Thessaloniki</b>, in Macedonia, Greece, is a living ancient city, with ruins and architecture from many different ages.
        It is the second largest city in Greece with a population of just over one million. In ancient times, it was known as the co-capital to Constantinople.
        It is a melting pot of different cultures and including ancient Roman, Ottoman, and Jewish impressions mixed in with the Greek. It was also named after the sister of Alexander the great.
        Being a proper European city, it also has a very active and lively culture. For example, every year they have a book fair on the boardwalk, extensive Christmas celebrations, and every now and then an old destroyer named the Velos will lay anchor for tourists.
        They also just completed a metro system. Probably the most interesting things in <b>Thessaloniki</b> though are the ancient ruins and museums.
        <b>Thessaloniki</b> as an ancient city is full of archeological sites, so many in fact that it complicates construction, and some deep constructions double as museums.
        But there is no shortage of proper museums around <b>Thessaloniki</b>. They also have some really awesome, still standing, ancient ruins. Up on the mountainside of the city, there are some really cool castle ruins that tourists and residents can enter and enjoy.
        There is also the White Tower, which is the remains of a costal defense wall. There is a story that during the ottoman occupation, the tower was used as a prison, and it is called the white tower as one prisoner painted the bloodied tower white in exchange for freedom.

            <div>
                <p>Thessaloniki also has some great restaurants and a ton of farmers&apos; markets, with some amazing food; here is a list of my favorite:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bougatsa, a flat pastry made of filo dough, creme, and powdered sugar.</li>
                    <li>Peinirli, like a folded up pizza, but can be filled with ham or cream or cheese or any combination.</li>
                    <li>Cart Corn, carts on the boardwalk will sell corn.</li>
                    <li>Tsoureki, a sweet bread with nuts and spices in it.</li>
                    <li>Profiterole, like a cream puff but chocolate pudding.</li>
                    <li>Trigona, translates directly to triangle, is a sweet cream wrapped in filo dough in the shape of a triangle.</li>
                    <li>Pita Gyro, which is like a handheld vertical taco, filled with all sorts of additives and gyro meat, which is cut from a large rotating piece of meat.</li>
                    <li>Koulori, very famous for Thessaloniki, it is kind of like a baked sesame bagel.</li>
                    <li>Stafidopsomo, bread with embedded raisins.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thessaloniki, being a lively city, has tons of things to do. Here are some things I would recommend:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go for a walk on the boardwalk.</li>
                    <li>Go on the archeological circuit.</li>
                    <li>Visit the old destroyer, Velos, which translates to arrow.</li>
                    <li>Ascend the White Tower.</li>
                    <li>Shop in the agora or the farmer&apos;s market.</li>
                    <li>Go swimming, it has great beaches, and is nearby <b>PERFECT</b> beaches!</li>
                    <li>Visit the old town to see the historic architecture.</li>
                    <li>Go to one fancy restaurant, the are some really creative places.</li>
                    <li>Visit plaza Aristoteles.</li>
                </ol>

        There is a saying that “<i>in Thessaloniki you sleep well</i>”. Here the culture is laid back, people take a siesta in the early afternoon, when shops close and people take naps.
        But then during the evening, people go out and the atmosphere is very lively, often people are out and about until 11:00. Despite being a large city, it has a communal feel to it.
        You won&apos;t find much New York style: “hey I&apos;m walking here!”. Like many places in the Mediterranean, there is a famous hospitality. There is a high density of trees, plazas, and parks.
        The biggest thing to worry about might be loud motorcycles at night, a ridiculous amount of mosquitos in the summer, and some racist taxi drivers.
        Farther out though, there are other concerns, like pervasive wildfires and economic troubles, but Thessaloniki is usually insulated from those.
        Speaking of insulated, sitting at sea level and at the end of the Mediterranean, Thessaloniki has an extremely mild climate. Snow is rare except for the mountains near by.
        There is also a large college life around Thessaloniki, with a very large university and student body. While most cities in Greece revolve around tourism part of the year, like Athens, Thessaloniki is a lived-in city.
        The tourist experience here is more authentic than say Santorini, which has specific places for influencers to take pictures. Despite a lot of ancient influence, much of Thessaloniki is actually quite modern.
        The Thessaloniki people recognize today is actually a reconstruction after a massive fire in 1917 which burned much of the city down. The roads are very organized, as opposed to an unplanned ancient city.
        All in all, Thessaloniki is a very unique and interesting place, that I am proud to consider one of my hometowns.
